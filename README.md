UbuntuIndicatorWeather is a very simple weather indicator for Ubuntu
unity and Gnome 3. It is developed with Python and uses two web service

Map](http://api.openweathermap.org/) to detect user's location and
temperature respectively.

## Dependencies
* Python 2.7 (Python 3 is not supported)
* Python gtk library
* Python appindicator library

## How to use
Calling `./weather-indicator.py` will start the applet. Pass `--help`
for the list of options.
